      <p>Hello {{data.firstName}},</p>
      <p>My office is excited to start using the neuroSHARE questionnaire. It will help me gather information about your
        health and how you are doing. Please take some time to complete the questionnaire anytime before your next appointment
        on {{data.appDate}}. </p>
      <p><b>How it works</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> You can complete the questionnaire securely online. Your answers are confidential and will only be shared with
          Sutter Health. </li>
        <li>You can move at your own pace, and you can stop and save your answers at any time. Return and finish it when
          you are ready.
        </li>
        <li> You can skip questions that you don’t wish to answer. The more questions you answer, the more likely I’ll be
          able to calculate your expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score. </li>
        <li> At the end you can make a list of what you’d like to talk about at your next appointment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>How it will help</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All of the information will be sent to me so I can review it before your next appointment. </li>
        <li> It will allow us to display your list and your information during your appointment so we can talk about it and
          use it to make decisions. </li>
        <li> It will make it easier for us to track changes over time. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please email {{data.email}} if you have any questions about the questionnaire. Thank you in advance for your time.
